Defining Servicegroups :-

Hostgroups can be defined on servicegroups.cfg file manually defined in /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects directory.
Also, create an entry in nagios.cfg to the location of servicegroups.cfg.

cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/servicegroups.cfg

Below are the sample service groups for web services just to show syntax.

define servicegroup {

       servicegroup_name                WEB
       alias                            Web Servers
       members                          host1, Check HTTP, webserver1, Check HTTP, webserver2, Check HTTP

}
