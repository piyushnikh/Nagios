# Nagios
Nagios Core, formerly known as Nagios, is a free and open-source computer-software application that monitors systems, networks and infrastructure. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications and services. In this repository I have worked on Nagios Core installation steps, pre-requisites & configuration on RHEL hosts for monitoring different services. Different component versions are Nagios Core Version v4.4.6, Nagios Plugins Version v2.2.3, Nagios NRPE version v4.1.0.

Since I have used EC2 RHEL Instances to work on this project, you can refer the below documentation from nagios official page for other flavors of Linux,
