# Nagios
Nagios Core, formerly known as Nagios, is a free and open-source computer-software application that monitors systems, networks and infrastructure. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications and services. In this repository I have worked on Nagios Core installation steps, pre-requisites & configuration on RHEL hosts for monitoring different services. Different component versions are Nagios Core Version v4.4.6, Nagios Plugins Version v2.2.3, Nagios NRPE version v4.1.0.

Some important references which helped me during this project work for better understanding.
