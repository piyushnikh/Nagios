Defining hostgroups :-

Hostgroups can be defined on hostgroup.cfg file manually defined in /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects directory.
Below are the two sample host groups for linux & web servers just to show syntax.

define hostgroup {
       hostgroup_name              Linux Servers
       alias                       Linux App Servers
       members                     host1, webserver1, webserver2
}

define hostgroup {
       hostgroup_name              Web Servers
       alias                       Web Servers - NGINX
       members                     webserver1, webserver2
}
